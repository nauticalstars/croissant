          A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using
          the French
          yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are named for their historical crescent
          shape, the
          dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in
          a
          technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

        <p>Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
          antiquity.[2]
          Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was
          developed in
          the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
          laminated
          dough.[3] In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them
          into a fast
          food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain,
          was a
          French response to American-style fast food,[4] and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French
          bakeries and
          patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[5]</p>
